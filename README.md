-  Hi, I’m @BorkFighters
-  I’m interested in getting better at python and potentially branching out into java or other languages. 
-  However, if you mean like games and shows and stuff, you can go to borkfighters.carrd.co for more info about that, but it's mostly anime, manga, and games.
-  I’m currently learning python. I'm taking my first coding classes right now.
-  How to reach me: twitter @BorkFighters
-  I don't normally type this formally, it just felt right for this.
-  Follow me on twitter please I need twitter followers
